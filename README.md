# Stack Implementation Using Linked List in Java

## Description
This Java program demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure using a singly linked list. It supports essential stack operations such as push (inserting an element), pop (removing the top element), peek (viewing the top element), and displaying all elements in the stack. The program features a console-based menu for interactive usage, making it an excellent resource to understand stack behavior and linked list manipulation.

## Features
- Push data onto the stack
- Pop data from the stack with underflow check
- Peek to see the top element without removing it
- Display all stack elements
- User-friendly menu-driven interface

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `stack.java`
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac stack.java
